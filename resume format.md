Here are the best resume format recommendations for a senior .NET developer like yourself:

## **Recommended Format: Modern ATS-Friendly Template**

**Best Options (in order of preference):**

1. **Microsoft Word with ATS Template**
   - Use Word's built-in "Professional" or "Simple" templates
   - Stick to standard fonts: Calibri, Arial, or Times New Roman
   - Single-column layout with clear section headers
   - Easily editable anywhere with Word/Google Docs

2. **Google Docs Professional Template**
   - "Spearmint" or "Coral" templates work well
   - Cloud-based, editable from anywhere
   - Automatic saving and version control
   - Easy to export as PDF when applying

3. **Canva's ATS-Friendly Templates**
   - Search for "ATS Resume" templates
   - Clean, professional designs
   - Web-based editing
   - Export as Word doc or PDF

## **Key ATS-Friendly Structure:**
```
[Header: Name, Phone, Email, LinkedIn, Location]

[Professional Summary - your Code Craftsman paragraph]

[Core Strengths - 4 bullet points max]

[Professional Experience]
- Company | Job Title | Dates
- 3-4 bullet points with metrics/achievements

[Technical Skills]
- Organized by category (Languages, Frameworks, Tools, Databases)

[Education]

[Certifications - if applicable]
```

## **ATS Best Practices:**
- **No graphics, tables, or columns**
- **Standard section headers** (Experience, Skills, Education)
- **Simple bullet points** (â€¢, not fancy symbols)
- **Standard date format** (MM/YYYY)
- **Keywords from job descriptions**
- **Save as .docx AND .pdf versions**

**My recommendation:** Start with a Word template, customize it with your content, then save it to OneDrive/Google Drive for universal access. This gives you the professional look of LaTeX with the flexibility of easy editing anywhere.

Would you like me to create a specific template structure with your content that follows these guidelines?

Here are a few important adjustments and additions to consider for your senior-level .NET developer resume:

## **Essential Additions:**

**1. Quantified Achievements Section**
- Add metrics to your experience bullets: "Reduced application load time by 40%" or "Led team of 5 developers"
- Include business impact: "Delivered system handling $2M+ daily transactions"

**2. Technical Skills - Be Specific**
```
Languages: C#, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript
Frameworks: .NET Core/Framework, ASP.NET MVC/Web API, Entity Framework
Cloud: Azure (App Service, SQL Database, Functions)
Tools: Visual Studio, Git, Docker, Jenkins/Azure DevOps
```

**3. Leadership/Architecture Examples**
- Since you have 18 years, add 1-2 bullets showing architectural decisions or team leadership

## **Format Adjustments:**

**1. Length:** 2 pages is appropriate for your experience level
**2. Experience:** Focus on last 10-12 years (older roles can be condensed)
**3. Order Priority:**
   - Summary â†’ Core Strengths â†’ Experience â†’ Technical Skills â†’ Education

## **Consider Adding (if applicable):**
- **Key Projects:** 2-3 notable systems you've built
- **Certifications:** Microsoft Azure, AWS, or other relevant certs
- **Speaking/Mentoring:** If you've done tech talks or formal mentoring

## **Remove/Minimize:**
- Technologies older than 5-7 years (unless still relevant)
- Early career roles (pre-2015) can be just company/title/dates

The format you have is solid - these additions will make it more compelling for senior-level positions where they expect to see leadership, impact, and architectural thinking beyond just coding skills.

You can share your resume content with me in several ways:

## **Best Options:**

**1. Copy & Paste Directly**
- Just paste your current resume content directly in the chat
- I can work with any format (text, bullet points, etc.)

**2. Upload Your Current File**
- If you have a Word doc, PDF, or text file, you can upload it using the attachment button (ðŸ“Ž) in the chat interface
- I can read and work with various file formats

**3. Section by Section**
- Share one section at a time if your resume is very long
- Start with: Current job history, then technical skills, education, etc.

## **What I'll Do:**

Once you share your content, I'll:
1. **Restructure it** into the ATS-friendly format we discussed
2. **Add quantified achievements** where possible (you can fill in specific metrics)
3. **Organize technical skills** by category
4. **Create a clean template** you can easily edit in Word/Google Docs
5. **Ensure proper ATS formatting** with standard headers and structure

## **Pro Tip:**
If your current resume is in LaTeX, just copy the text content - don't worry about the formatting. I'll handle restructuring it into the professional template.

Go ahead and share your content however is most convenient for you!

4. **Business value:** What cost savings or efficiency gains did you deliver?
5. **Technical challenges:** What complex problems did you solve?

Would you like to work through any specific section with concrete examples, or do you have metrics you can share for these enhancement areas?
