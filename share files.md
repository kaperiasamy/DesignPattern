Great question! Since you dual-boot, the simplest and most reliable way to share files is to use a Windows-friendly partition (NTFS or exFAT) that both systems can read and write. Here are three solid ways, from quickest to most robust.

---

# Option A — Quick copy using your existing Windows partition (manual mount)

1. In Windows 11: turn off Fast Startup

   * Control Panel → Power Options → Choose what the power buttons do → Change settings that are currently unavailable → uncheck “Turn on fast startup” → Save.
   * Optional (prevents hibernation locks): open Command Prompt as Admin →
     `powercfg /h off`

2. Reboot into Ubuntu 25.04.

3. Mount the Windows partition in Ubuntu (GUI)

   * Open Files → Other Locations → under “Devices” click your Windows volume (often labeled “OS”, “Windows”, or the drive letter).
   * It mounts under `/media/<your-user>/<VolumeLabel>`.

4. Copy files to and from that mounted drive.

   * Anything you put there will be visible next time you boot Windows.

Notes

* If BitLocker is enabled, Ubuntu will prompt to unlock it. If it doesn’t, you can use the `dislocker` package, but the GUI prompt usually suffices.
* Avoid writing to the Windows partition if Windows was hibernated or Fast Startup is on (risk of data loss).

# Option B — Create a dedicated “Shared” partition (recommended, tidy and reliable)

This gives you a neutral space both OSes use, independent of C:.

1. In Windows: create the partition

   * Win+X → Disk Management.
   * Right-click your main Windows partition (usually C:) → Shrink Volume → shrink by the size you want (e.g., 50 GB).
   * In the new unallocated space: New Simple Volume → format as **NTFS** (or **exFAT** if you also share with Macs) → label it `Shared`.

2. Boot into Ubuntu and mount it once to test

   * Open Files → the new `Shared` drive appears → click to mount.
   * It will mount under `/media/<your-user>/Shared`.

3. Make it auto-mount in Ubuntu (so it’s always there)
   a) Find its UUID

   ```bash
   lsblk -f
   ```

   Note the UUID of the `Shared` partition.
   b) Create a mount point

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/shared
   ```

   c) Add an fstab entry (for NTFS)

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```

   Add a line (replace YOUR-UUID):

   ```
   UUID=YOUR-UUID  /mnt/shared  ntfs-3g  defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=022  0  0
   ```

   Save, then test:

   ```bash
   sudo mount -a
   ```

   * Now use `/mnt/shared` in Ubuntu; in Windows it shows as the `Shared` drive letter you created.

Why NTFS vs exFAT?

* **NTFS:** Best when Windows is primary; supports permissions and large files.
* **exFAT:** Simple, cross-platform, good for external drives; lacks permissions but fine for general sharing.

# Option C — Access Ubuntu’s ext4 from Windows (advanced, optional)

If you specifically need to read your Ubuntu partition while booted into Windows:

* **WSL 2 mount** (Windows 11):

  * Requires Windows Subsystem for Linux and `wsl --mount`. This is advanced and can require mounting the whole disk; not ideal for everyday use.
* **Third-party drivers/tools:** Paragon “Linux File Systems for Windows” (paid) works well; free options like Ext2Fsd are outdated.
* For most users, **Option B** (shared NTFS partition) is simpler and safer.

# Quick checklist to avoid issues

* Disable Windows Fast Startup and avoid hibernation.
* Always do a full shutdown of Windows before writing to its partitions from Ubuntu.
* If using BitLocker, unlock the drive in Ubuntu when prompted.
* Prefer a dedicated shared partition to keep things tidy.

Want me to generate the exact `/etc/fstab` line for you? Tell me the `lsblk -f` output (just for the shared partition), and I’ll craft it so you can paste it in.
