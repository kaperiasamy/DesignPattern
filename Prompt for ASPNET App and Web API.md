I want to create a ASP.NET Core Web Application along with Web API with the following features:
It should use Entity Framework Core. It should implemented the non-functional requirements. Include how to secure the API. Also implement rate limiting features. Detailed dependency injection options should be there. Implement the middlewares for error handling and logging. Implement authentication and authorization. Also include the features like how to avoid SQL Injection and XSRF attacts. Enable encryption using TLS. 
Here is the application detail: The application has a user login page. Once the user logged in, the in time is recorded. Once the user logs out, the out time is recorded. The in and out time should not overlop. 
Provide me the complete code with comments so that I can understand and explain to the interviewer.

**Prompt:**

Create a complete ASP.NET Core Web Application with a Web API that demonstrates best practices and includes the following:

1. Core Features

   * Use Entity Framework Core for database access.
   * Implement a user login page where:

     * On login, the user‚Äôs in-time is recorded.
     * On logout, the user‚Äôs out-time is recorded.
     * Ensure in-time and out-time do not overlap.

2. Non-Functional Requirements

   * Implement authentication and authorization.
   * Secure the API using TLS encryption.
   * Add rate limiting to control API usage.
   * Use dependency injection with detailed options.
   * Implement middlewares for:

     * Error handling
     * Logging
   * Protect against SQL Injection and XSRF attacks.

3. Expected Output

   * Provide the complete code implementation.
   * Add comments in the code to explain the logic.
   * Ensure the explanation is clear enough for me to understand and present during an interview.

Perfect ‚Äî here are **two optimized prompts**, one tailored for **ChatGPT** (for step-by-step teaching + code) and another for **GitHub Copilot** (for in-editor code generation).

## ‚úÖ Optimized Prompt for ChatGPT

*(Detailed, step-by-step with explanations for interview prep)*

Prompt:
I want you to act as a mentor and help me build an ASP.NET Core Web Application with Web API for interview preparation. Please:

1. Step-by-step explanation and code

   * Show how to set up the project.
   * Explain folder structure and configuration.
   * Provide commented code for each part.

2. Requirements

   * Use Entity Framework Core for database operations.
   * Create a user login/logout system where:

     * On login, user in-time is recorded.
     * On logout, user out-time is recorded.
     * In-time and out-time must not overlap.
   * Implement authentication and authorization.
   * Secure the API with TLS encryption.
   * Add rate limiting for API endpoints.
   * Demonstrate dependency injection options.
   * Add middlewares for:

     * Error handling
     * Logging
   * Protect against SQL Injection and XSRF attacks.

3. Delivery

   * Provide the full working code (controllers, models, services, middlewares, etc).
   * Include comments in the code so I can understand and explain to the interviewer.
   * Provide a short summary of each implementation choice.

## ‚úÖ Optimized Prompt for GitHub Copilot

*(Concise, coding-focused inside IDE editor)*

Prompt:
Create an ASP.NET Core Web API project with the following:

* Use Entity Framework Core with a `User` entity to record login/logout times.
* On login, save in-time. On logout, save out-time. Prevent overlapping sessions.
* Implement authentication and authorization with JWT.
* Add middlewares for error handling and logging.
* Implement rate limiting for APIs.
* Configure dependency injection for services and repositories.
* Apply security best practices: prevent SQL Injection, handle XSRF, and enforce TLS.
* Provide clean, well-commented code for models, controllers, services, and middleware.

üëâ The **ChatGPT prompt** is best for learning + interview prep (step-by-step + explanations).
üëâ The **Copilot prompt** is best for generating code quickly inside VS Code / JetBrains Rider.



--- 

Great idea üëç Splitting the **ChatGPT prompt** into **multi-turn tasks** will make the AI guide you step by step (like a mentor), instead of overwhelming you with all code at once.

Here‚Äôs how you can break it down:

---

## Multi-turn ChatGPT Prompt Plan

### Turn 1 ‚Äì Project Setup

*"Help me create an ASP.NET Core Web API project from scratch. Show me the folder structure, Program.cs setup, and initial configurations. Explain each step clearly."*

---

### Turn 2 ‚Äì Database and Entity Framework Core

*"Now, integrate Entity Framework Core. Create a User entity with properties for Id, Username, Password, InTime, and OutTime. Configure the DbContext and connection string. Show me migration and database update steps."*

---

### Turn 3 ‚Äì Login/Logout Feature

*"Please implement login and logout APIs. On login, record the in-time. On logout, record the out-time. Make sure in-time and out-time do not overlap. Show me the controller and service code with comments."*

---

### Turn 4 ‚Äì Authentication and Authorization

*"Add authentication and authorization using JWT in the Web API. Secure the login/logout endpoints properly. Show me how to configure authentication in Program.cs and how to apply \[Authorize] attributes."*

---

### Turn 5 ‚Äì Middleware (Error Handling and Logging)

*"Implement middleware for error handling and logging. Show me how exceptions are caught and logged, and how to return proper error responses. Provide commented middleware code."*

---

### Turn 6 ‚Äì Dependency Injection

*"Explain and demonstrate dependency injection in this project. Show examples of registering services, repositories, and logging providers in Program.cs. Also explain constructor injection."*

---

### Turn 7 ‚Äì Security Best Practices

*"Show me how to prevent SQL Injection in EF Core queries. Also demonstrate how to protect against XSRF/CSRF attacks in Web API. Explain how TLS/HTTPS is enabled in ASP.NET Core."*

---

### Turn 8 ‚Äì Rate Limiting

*"Add rate limiting to the Web API to restrict the number of requests per user. Show me how to configure it in Program.cs with examples."*

---

### Turn 9 ‚Äì Final Review and Explanation

*"Please provide the complete code for the project (controllers, models, services, middleware) with comments. Also summarize how each feature works so that I can confidently explain it in an interview."*

üëâ Using this flow, ChatGPT will act like a trainer, walking you step by step through the project. You can copy-paste each prompt in sequence.
