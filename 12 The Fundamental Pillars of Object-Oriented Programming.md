## The Fundamental Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

> Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism are the four pillars of object-oriented programming. What do they mean?

1 - **Abstraction**
This is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. For example, a Vehicle class an abstract stop method.

2 - **Encapsulation**
It involves wrapping data (fields) and methods in a single unit (class) and restricting direct access using access modifiers. For example, private fields public getters and setters.

3 - **Inheritance**
The process of creating a new class (child) that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (parent), thereby promoting code reuse. For example, a Car class inherits from a Vehicle class.

4 - **Polymorphism**
It  allows methods to perform differently based on the object they are  invoked on. When two types share an inheritance chain, they can be used  interchangeably with no errors.
